Benchmarks Of Many ARM Boards From The Raspberry Pi To NVIDIA Jetson TX2
Written by Michael Larabel in Computers on 19 March 2017. Page 2 of 5 . 37 Comments

To little surprise, the Jetson boards were many times faster than these other -- generally very inexpensive -- ARM SBCs. This isn't even showing the full potential of Tegra/Jetson either with the tests in this article being CPU-only focused and not taking advantage of any graphics/compute capabilities considering these other cheap ARM boards aren't designed for such workloads.

With John The Ripper, the other ARM boards were still behind Jetson but not by as big of margins as in the FFTW workload.

It's interesting to look at the ARM performance spectrum. Adding in x86 comparison points will also be fun.

The Orange Pi One is the slowest ARM board in this comparison, but it's also the cheapest at around $10 USD.
