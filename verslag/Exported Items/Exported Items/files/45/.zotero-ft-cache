Simplify your programming

To get you up and running as fast as possible, we offer free software libraries for Arduino, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black . Pixy also makes your life easier by only sending  the data you‚Äôre looking for . For example, if you teach Pixy a purple object, you will only receive data (X-Y coordinates, size, and unique ID) about purple objects.
